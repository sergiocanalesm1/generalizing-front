They believed that how the plating was arranged and how the food tasted was the dialogue the cook established with the costumer. The balance between these two seems to be important: if a cook focuses too much on plating and little on the taste, the food communicates the idea that the cook values more what is seen rather than what is tasted (the outside over the inside). Likewise, the body language of the costumer is his establishment of dialogue with the cook. A good posture means he respects the food and therefore the cook.",

They dropped Greek mythology and pursued explanation of nature through investigation, through reason. This is what is now called physics. There was no interest in investigating love, politics, freedom and such metaphysical concepts. They were focus on explaining the way of the stars, the moon, the sun; nature beyond man.

They are very dense, as their volume is similar to that of planet earth and its mass is similar to that of our sun (too much mass is encapsulated in such a little space). This creates a huge gravitational pull on its core, much more stronger than its hydrostatic force (which should counter that gravitational force so that it doesn't collapse). However, these dying stars are composed mostly of electrons, and these particles (categorized as fermions) follow a statistical property which states that they dislike being close to each other. They 'resist' being brought together, and this is what counters the huge gravitational force. This statistical property of electrons is the reason for white dwarfs existence."

He suggests that the main three interventions that produce sustainable, high growth development are: 1. To maximize output from agriculture, which employs a lot of people in poor countries. 2. To direct investment and entrepreneurs towards manufacturing, often times through subsidies conditional on export performance. 3. Financial sector revolution to focus capital on intensive, small-scale agriculture and manufacturing enterprises following the first two interventions. Firms often had to show export orders to secure credit.  To illustrate how these policies shaped modern nations today, he explores the case for each of the previously mentioned interventions in the nations dubbed the Asian Growth Miracles: China, South Korea, and Japan.",

There are three main ways to calculate it.  1. Value Added Approach:  This method consists of adding the value of goods when they are sold between buyers and subtracting the costs associated to the production of these products. It is as if it were saying that goods only have value towards GDP once they are sold as a final good. If there is no transaction, there is no value.    2. Expenditure Approach: In this method, we add the different components that make up GDP. GDP = C + I + G + (X-M). Where C is consumption, I is investment (net of depreciation and including changes in inventory), G is government expenditures net of transfers, X is exports, and M is imports. This is my preferred method as it is the most efficient and straightforward to put into practice.   3. Income Approach: As I understand it, this method consists summing all types of incomes that are received within a country. For example, these include: wages, corporate profits, rental income, net interest, etc. This approach is long and tedious.",

Low levels of it have been linked to osteoporosis, cancer, depression and muscle weakness. It’s important to know that the sun’s UVB rays, which when in contact with the skin provide the energy for vitamin D synthesis to occur, cannot enter through windows, so people who work next to sunny windows are still prone to vitamin D deficiency. The right way of getting all your necessary vitamin D in is: first, exposing around a third of your skin to the sun; wearing a tank top and shorts for 10–30 minutes (without sunscreen) three times per week during the summer should be enough for most people with lighter skin. People with darker skin may need a little bit longer. Second, it is recommended to expose at noon because the sun is at its highest point, and its UVB rays are most intense, plus many studies also show that the body is most efficient at making vitamin D at noon and you would need to expose for less time.",

On the other hand, the slow thinking deals with our working memory and is the one we use when solving something like 64*21. Our intuition happens so fast that we do not have time track where it came from. It just happens to be there, at the tip of our tongue. However, this kind of thinking is biased by our subconscious mind. This mysterious place registers so much information that we are not aware of, but that may be tampered by something (or someone) else.

This is the internal clock in the body, which basically informs it when to sleep, wake up, and eat in a 24 hour cycle. Circadian cycles are found in most living things including animals, plants, and tiny microbes. Even red blood cells keep time. Getting light exposure first thing in the morning is crucial when regulating the secretion of melatonin, a sleep-inducing hormone the body releases at night. Light suppresses melatonin secretion, which wakes the body up in the most natural posible way, plus it also releases hormones that are linked to an improved mood. When light tells the brain to shut down melatonin production, it also releases more wake-promoting neurotransmitters like dopamine, norepinephrine, and histamine, which can make people feel good.",

Then a really really small hole must be opened in the container so that a small amount of the gas can effuse. Here is the trick: effusion 'selects' lighter particles to come out of the container.

When we repeat something, we are reinforcing the link between those neurons in our brain and the stronger the link is, the harder it is to forget. This may be great for some things, however,  this also implies that our brain is really good at remembering mistakes. For example, we all have, at least once, written an essay or a text explaining an idea (like I'm doing right now). We have all experienced the frustration of proofreading and not finding any typos, however, when someone else reads it, they find the typo in their first glance. Why does this happen? we read the text so many times that its mistakes get stored in our memory. That is why, as the book explains, whenever we write something, the best thing we can do to proofread it is to immediately start doing something else so that we can forget about it and be able to find our mistakes more easily",
